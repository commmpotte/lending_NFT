# lending_NFT
Single page landing NFT website

In this part of the road to FE development, I created the NFT lending one-page website. I got some experience with Gulp.js and SCSS. Also, I explored the animated scroll library AOS (https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/), SVG images generator svgSprive, and swiper (https://swiperjs.com/get-started). 

How to start? I was using bash terminal. In one window (in real time) start with: npm run dev. In another window don't forget to collect your svg-icons: npm run svgSprive. 

Of course I know, that "landind" is writing with a letter "a". Sorry about that!
